# MusicStorageAccounting

This project for OOP discipline.
Theme is accounting music storage like vinyl record, cassette, CD, etc. 

I choosed MongoDB for saving data, because a playlist have complicated structure and it is not easy to save it in sql.
You can see structure of database in diagram_of_classes.png.
